# Project-CaliforniaHousingDataset
This repository contains a model using the California Housing Dataset.  The project is about to  create a Linear Regression model with Stochastic Gradient Descent with specific penalty parameters and compare its accuracy with a Linear Regression model.

b. Objectives:

1. Read the data.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Feature selection.
4. Using K-cross validation with K as 5, building 3 linear regression models and comparing their performance:

- First model: Linear Regression model with Stochastic Gradient Descent with a penalty of 'Elastic Net'.
- Second model: Linear Regression model with Stochastic Gradient Descent with a penalty of 'Ridge Regression'.
- Third model: Ordinaty Linear Regression model.

c. Data:
The data we will use is the California Housing Dataset from sklearn datasets, StatLib repository. We can see as follow the description of the variables:
